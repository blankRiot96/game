## Story Plot
Jenna was out with her friends one day playing chess in their usual spot. The park is usually quite and has a couple tables and benches for people to sit and talk, or in Jenna's case - play chess. She is an intermediate chess player and enjoys competing with her friends for the top spot. 

Today however, they saw a mysterious chess board laid out in their usual table. They go near it to check it out. Normally, they'd just mind their own business in the other table, but this chess board... was alluring. They decide to play using it, almost as if they couldn't resist. After sitting down, they notice that the chess board has 4 different colored pieces, all scattered around the board with no particular order. They also notice there are a lot more than 64 squares, and the pieces are smaller. The chess pieces look kind of modified, more demonic even. 

Curious, Jenna picks up the Queen-  BOOM!

Jenna opens her eyes and finds herself in a strange space. The tiles are alternately colored, just like... in that demonic chess board! She looks around and sees a creature that resembles a rook looking right at her. *gasp* It's charging right at her! She quickly dodges and swings the closest sword she finds.
